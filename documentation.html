<h2 id="sec-1">1 Introduction </h2>
<div id="text-1">

<p>CitrusDB is an open source customer service and billing
database. It can be used by customer service personnel to provide
sales and support to customers, and by billing staff to bill
customers for their services via invoices and credit card batches.
Customers may access the Online customer account manager to view
their services, billing history, and make service and support
requests online.
</p>
<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
<li> PHP 5.2 or greater
<li> MySQL 4.1 or greater
<li> An SSL Certificate for the domain where it will be installed (Can be self signed)
<li> A GPG Key Pair if you are storing credit card data
<li> A Web Browser with Cookies and Javascript
</ul>
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">2 Chapter 1: Installation </h2>
<div id="text-2">

<p>Before you install CitrusDB you should check whether a web
server with the  PHP module, and MySQL database are installed on your
server.  To check whether MySQL, and PHP are installed in
your server correctly you can upload a simple PHP file to your
server that contains the following code:
</p>



<pre class="example">
   &lt;?php
   phpinfo();
   ?&gt;
</pre>




<p>
View your uploaded file in a web browser by going to your site, eg:
www.yourname.com/file.php  This will show you what version of PHP
you are running and a lot of information about your PHP
installation.  Further down the screen there will be a section
about your MySQL installation that will confirm whether MySQL is
supported by your PHP installation.  If the file you uploaded does
not load, give an error, or does not show anything about MySQL,
your server is not configured correctly.  You will need to fix this
before you continue.
</p>
<p>
There are many methods to install a web server, MySQL and PHP on your
server.  On Linux you will  usually be able to find a package
available for your distro that you can install via a package
manager like synaptic, apt-get, or yum.  Mac OS X already has
Apache installed by default, all you'll need to do is enable PHP
and install MySQL or you can use a pre-built package like XAMPP.
If you are using Windows you can try the pre-built packages like
XAMPP that include all the pieces you need for Apache, MySQL, and
PHP.  Microsoft also maintains PHP packages available for windows servers.
</p>
<p>
After you have installed your server software you can begin
installing CitrusDB.  The main internal application is the largest
part of CitrusDB.  It is built for use by customer service
representatives to handle customer service queries and sales,
billing staff to send bills and process payments, and by
administrators to activate new services, deactivate services, and
monitor customer service operations.
</p>
<p>
If you are simply trying out CitrusDB it can be installed on any
server you like.  When using CitrusDB with real production data it
should be installed on a private LAN or on a well protected web
server with limited access by using firewalls and SSL, or other
comparable security measures to protect your customer data and
limit access to only you and your staff.  Follow the steps below to
begin your installation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.1">2.1 Installing the Main Internal Application </h3>
<div id="text-2.1">

<ul>
<li>
Un-tar and un-gzip the citrus file wherever you want the
CitrusDB program to be located on your web server. 

</li>
<li>
Create a MySQL database called "citrus" and import the citrus.sql
file into it. You can do this using a utility like phpMyAdmin or the
command line like the one shown here:




<pre class="example">
      mysqladmin create citrus
      mysql citrus &lt; /path/to/citrusdb/citrus.sql 
</pre>




</li>
<li>
Create a MySQL database user with access to the citrus database
you just created.

</li>
<li>
Edit the database configuration file: /citrusdb/application/config/database.php
</li>
<li>
Change the database hostname, to your server name, often this will
be the localhost it is all on one server.  Enter your database
username and password that you just created before.

<pre class="example">
      $db['default']['hostname']='localhost';
      $db['default']['username']='username';
      $db['default']['password']='password';
</pre>

<li>
Next edit the configuration file: /citrusdb/application/config/config.inc.php
</li>

<li>
Set the regular url and ssl url prefixes for your site.  You should use the same
name for both the regular url and ssl url with the only difference being http or
https for the protocol.  This will ensure the session cookie assigned during ssl
login is available to the regular http url as well.
<p>
You may use a self-signed certificate for this function as long as all the users
of the database have that SSL certificate installed into their browsers.
The CitrusDB project is an affiliate of 
<a href="https://www.certs4less.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1035&url=3">Certs4Less</a> 
where you can get an SSL certificate signed by a number of certificate authorities at different levels of authentication.

<pre class="example">
      $config['base_url'] = "http://server.example.com/citrusdb/";
      $config['ssl_base_url'] = "https://server.example.com/citrusdb/";
</pre>

</li>

<li>
Set the gpg command that will be used for encryption
of stored credit card data.  In order to use gpg you must
generate a public and private keypair.  It is probably a good
idea to generate a gpg keypair just for citrusdb to use.  This
public key can then be used on the order side to store credit card
numbers before they are imported as well as storing cards
entered directly into citrusdb.

<p>
To generate a keypair run the command: gpg &ndash;gen-key
</p>
<p>
I recommend using the shortest recommended key length of 1024
bits since this key will be used over and over again, using the
shorter key length will make decryption faster.  This is a trade
off of speed vs. strength.  One could also use gpg with the
symmetric encryption option or any other encryption system that can
output an OpenPGP ascii armor message format.  Symmetric
encryption could be significantly faster, however it will
require protection of the passphrase that is used when
encrypting the card data.
</p>
<p>
The example shown below stores the gpg key as the www-data user
in their home directory.  This home directory was created for
the user that the web server is running as.  This is the easiest way
to make sure that the web server running citrusdb has access to the keys
that it will use to encrypt and decrypt the card data.  If the web
server where you run citrusdb is inside your network and
dedicated to your internal use this should not be
an issue.  If you are unable
to do this, then you will need to modify the permissions of your
.gnupg folder and the keyrings inside of it to be readable by
everyone.  This is less desireable as it may expose them to other
users of that system as well as cause permission problems in the
future if you edit keys.
</p>



<pre class="example">
      $config['gpg_command'] = "/usr/bin/gpg --homedir /home/www-data/.gnupg
      --armor --batch -e -r 'CitrusDB'";
</pre>




</li>
<li>
Set the gpg decrypt command that is used when decrypting the
cards for batch exports or when re-keying the data.  The decrypt
command must include the &ndash;passphrase-fd 0 command because the
passphrase will be passed to gpg by citrus's decryption
function.  




<pre class="example">
      $config['gpg_decrypt'] = "/usr/bin/gpg --homedir /home/www-data/.gnupg
      --passphrase-fd 0 --yes --no-tty --skip-verify --decrypt";
</pre>




</li>
<li>
Set the gpg sign command will be used by citrus to verify
the passphrase entered before creating a batch file.  




<pre class="example">
      $config['gpg_sign'] = "/usr/bin/gpg --homedir /home/www-data/.gnupg
      --passphrase-fd 0 --yes --no-tty --clearsign -u 'CitrusDB'";
</pre>




</li>
<li>
If you would like to use an LDAP server to authenticate users 
you can setup the ldap variables.  Set the ldap<sub>enable</sub> variable
to TRUE and the other variables to correspond to your LDAP configuration.
You should make sure you have configured your ldap server to work
with ssl so that the data passed between the web server and the ldap 
server is not able to be intercepted by using the ldaps protocol.

</li>
<li>
You will need to have the user configured inside of the citrus user
utilities to allow them to login with LDAP, but you can manage their 
password using your LDAP system.




<pre class="example">
     $config['ldap_enable'] = FALSE;
     $config['ldap_host'] = 'ldaps://localhost';
     $config['ldap_dn'] = 'ou=webapps,dc=localhost';
     $config['ldap_protocol_version'] = 3;
     $config['ldap_uid_field'] = 'uid'; 
</pre>


</li>
<li>
If you have an xmpp or jabber server for ticket notifications you can setup
those xmpp account variables to allow citrus to send ticket notifications
via xmpp instant messages.

<pre class="example">
$config['xmpp_server'] = "";
$config['xmpp_user'] = "";
$config['xmpp_password'] = "";
$config['xmpp_domain'] = "";
</pre>




</li>
<li>
A shipment tracking website URL like the one for US Postal, FedEx, or 
UPS can be entered if you want to use the field asset
tracking number field when shipping field assets to customers.




<pre class="example">
$config['tracking_url'] = "http://trkcnfrm1.smi.usps.com/PTSInternetWeb/InterLabelInquiry.do?origTrackNum=";
</pre>


<li>
Scroll down to the Default Language section and variable to point to your local language
file. This language file is located in the /citrusdb/appliation/language folder and holds the values for all the text in
CitrusDB as well as the currency symbol used.  Please note that
CitrusDB can only work with one currency.


<pre class="example">
      $config['language'] = 'english';
</pre>


</li>

<li>
Scroll down to the Encryption Key section to change this to your own secret phrase.

<pre class="example">
      $config['encryption_key']='youmustchangethis';
</pre>


</li>

</li>
<li>
add a cron job to run the statusupdate script (available in the
citrusdb folder) every night or after billing is done for the
day. This script will update the customer's account status and
create a file that can be used to activate and deactivate
customer services automatically. 

</li>
<li>
Go to your web site address /citrusdb/index.php, you can log in
with username "admin", password "test" to start.

</li>
</ul>

<p>You have now finished the main installation of CitrusDB.  It's a
good idea to login and change your admin password first.  If you
are not going to install the customer account manager can skip to
Chapter 2 - Setup, to continue to setup of the internal CitrusDB 
application.

<div id="outline-container-2.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.2">2.2 Customer Self-Service Portal</h3>
<div id="text-2.2">

<p>CitrusDB 3.0 now includes a new online customer portal api to create a portal that will allow your customers to view information about their own account, request changes, and
make updates.  It is recommended to put your portal web app on a seperate public web server and only have allow connections between it and your internal citrusdb server over https connections on port 443.  
<p>
There is an example of a portal in the /citrusdb/portal folder.  This is without any login that will automatically load the first example test account when their password is set to test.  You may use these examples to make a portal that uses this API to meet your unique customer portal needs.
</p>
<p>
The portal also uses codeigniter configurations 
customer system is configured similarly to the main
system by editing the config.inc.php file inside the 
citrusdb/online/include folder.  There are some additional
variables to configure for the online customer system.
</p>
<p>
The $payment_url variable should be set to whatever online
form or payment system you have such as authorize.net, paypal,
your own custom form etc. 
</p>
<p>
The $notify_user variable holds a username from the internal
system that will be notified of new requests that customers make online.

<h3 id="sec-2.3">2.3 Upgrading CitrusDB </h3>
<div id="text-2.3">

<p>When a there is a new installation or critical security update,
you will want to be able to upgrade your installation to the
latest release.  To update from an older version to a newer one:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Backup the php files by copying them to another location and
backup your citrus database by using a utility like mysqldump.




<pre class="example">
      mysqldump –user &lt;username&gt; –password &lt;passwd&gt; db_name &gt; backup.sql
</pre>




</li>
<li>
After you have backed up your current installation, replace the
old citrusdb files with the new ones from the package you downloaded

</li>
<li>
Edit the config.inc.php in /citrusdb/include with the database
and path information from your old config file.

</li>
<li>
To update your database schema from the old to the new, open the
update.php file in your web browser 
(www.example.com/citrusdb/update.php) and click the Update button.

</li>
<li>
Your database has now been updated, and you are ready to use
your new version of CitrusDB.    

</li>
<li>
If you are upgrading from version 1.x to 2.x you will need to
make sure you have setup the new gpg commands in the config file
and then run the encryptcards script to encrypt the cards in the database.

<h3 id="sec-3.1">3.1 Login </h3>
<div id="text-3.1">

<p>After you have installed CitrusDB the first thing you should do is
login with the default username (admin) and password (test) and
then go update the password to something new.  To update the
password, click on the Tools icon, and then click on Change
Password. Enter a new password for the default admin user.  
</p>
<p>
The login system will stop your login attempts from your IP
address  if you fail to login with the correct username and
password after 5 tries in the last 24 hours.  If this happens, your
IP address must be removed from the login_failures table by the
database administrator.    
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.2">3.2 Organization Configuration </h3>
<div id="text-3.2">


<p>
The Organization Configuration section holds information about the
company or organization using CitrusDB.  This should be the first
thing you configure when setting up CitrusDB.   The information is
used in many places for invoices, billing, and customer messages. 
</p>
<p>
The Billed By field holds the organization's brand name.  If you
have more than one organization brand name you can add multiple
organization brands using the Add link to create more than one
organization listing.  This is used to create bills under different
brand names and different credit card batches for those brands.  If
your organization does not need multiple brands you can simply edit
the default configuration.
</p>
<p>
Enter the organization's name that will
appear on the bill in the Billed By field.  Then the street, city,
state, zip, phone, and email information.  The billing phone and
billing email will appear on the printed and emailed invoices.  
</p>
<p>
Credit Card Export Variable Order is the order of the variables
that are exported in the credit card batch file for processing by
your credit card processing system.  You can export a number
of different variables.  All the available variables are listed at
the bottom of the organization screen.  Please note that you need to
put the $ in front of the variable name so that they are evaluated
correctly.  CitrusDB will insert the words "CREDIT" or "CHARGE" in quotes at the
beginning of the variables, depending on what kind of credit card 
transaction this is.  The recommended export format uses comma and quote
delimited items.  You must keep the commas between the items and
quotes around them to make sure other systems can import the
information correctly.
</p>



<pre class="example">
"$mybilling_id","$invoice_number,"$billing_ccnum","$billing_ccexp","$abstotal"...
</pre>




<p>
Export File Prefix is is appended to the beginning of all credit
card batch files exported by citrus.  If you have multiple
organizations exporting from the same citrus system, you can use
this file prefix name to identify which exported batches belong to
which organization.
</p>
<p>
Past Due Days are the number of days an account is past due before
the status is updated by the statusupdate script to one of the
three different past due status types: Past Due, Turned Off, or
Canceled.  
Past Due accounts will be noted as past due and will be notified in
email by 
the statusupdate script about their status.  A Turned Off status will
cause the account to send a disable message to the account
activation system, which can then disable access to the account.
An account in a Turned Off status should be disabled and
non-working.  The Canceled status is for accounts that have
been through the first two phases of being past due and have not
yet paid for services.  Canceled will send a delete message to
the  account activation system.  The account should be removed
from your systems, and if you have a collections department or
processing system, can be forwarded to them for past due amount
recovery.
</p>
<p>
Carrier Dependent Past Due Days are for third party services that
have special requirements when they are turned off.  They act the
same as normal Past Due Days however they have a Shutoff Notice
period in between being Past Due and having their service being
Turned Off.  This shutoff notice is to notify the customer that
their service will be turned off and also to notify the billing
group that the service is in jeopardy of being shutoff.  The
billing group will receive notifications when this service is to be
turned off or canceled, since they will need to be able to contact
the third party service carrier to handle type of cancel request.
</p>
<p>
The next fields are the four different kinds of invoice
notes that are printed at the bottom of the invoices according to
the account status.  The Default Invoice Note is printed on an
account in good standing, usually this is a note thanking them for
using your services.  The Past Due Invoice Note is printed on
invoices while an account is in the Past Due status.  The Turned
Off Invoice Note is printed on invoices while an account is in the
Turned Off status.  The Collections Invoice Note is printed on
invoices for accounts in the collections status.  These messages
can be overridden by entering a custom message in the Notes field
on the customer's billing record.
</p>
<p>
The declined subject and message field hold the data used in the
email that is sent to customers when their credit card has been
declined.  Here you should enter a message that will prompt them to
contact you and get their billing information up to date.
</p>
<p>
The last field is an invoice footer field that holds text that will be
placed at the bottom of every invoice.
</p>
<p>
After you have setup the organization information you are ready to save
your changes and continue setting up your CitrusDB system.

<div id="outline-container-3.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.3">3.3 Settings </h3>
<div id="text-3.3">


<p>
The settings tool holds system wide settings for citrus.
</p>
<p>
At the top of the Settings screen you will see a
Citrus Database Version and Citrus Software Version.  The database
version is the version of the SQL Schema that is being used.  The
software version indicates the version of the software application
files.  These two versions should be the same.  If they are
different it may mean that you have not run the update script to
update your database to the correct version or that you are
running a Pre-release version of CitrusDB.
</p>
<p>
The Path to Credit Card File should be set to a file path on the
server to a folder that is outside the path of the web server and
other network processes.  When credit card and account activation
data is created it will be saved to a new file inside this folder.
You can then write scripts that will automatically process new
files left in that folder, or download those files to process them
manually.  You should make a new folder to store this data in, for
example, on a Unix system you can set this to something like
</p>



<pre class="example">
   /var/billing 
</pre>




<p>
and on a Windows system it can be set to a path such
as 
</p>



<pre class="example">
   C:\billing
</pre>




<p>
This will keep this data outside of the web server
path, but will still allow it to be accessed by 3rd party scripts
running on the server that can process this data automatically.
</p>
<p>
The Default Group is used by the support notes and privileges
system to allow notifications to certain users.  Normally leaving
this as the default of "users" is recommended.
</p>
<p>
The Billing Group is a group that you will need to create if you
are using the carrier dependent services functions or if you are
using the Field Asset feature.  The status
update script will send the billing group notes if a carrier
dependent service is in a bad billing status, like past due, turned
off, or canceled with fees owed.  The field asset feature will send
a note to billing whenever a device is returned so that the billing
group knows the customer has returned a device and can take
measures necessary to adjust their bill.
</p>
<p>
The Shipping Group is a group that you will need to create if you
are going to use the Ship Field Asset feature.  Ship Field Assets
lets you associate a field asset like a CPE or other device with
that customer's service.  The shipping group will get a note when a
field asset is setup to be shipped.
</p>
<p>
The carrier dependent cancel url is for third party carrier
dependent services.  This can link to an internal web form or other
form when a carrier dependent service is canceled to notify the
third party carrier that this service is to be canceled.
</p>
<p>
The Billing Date Rollover time should be set to the time of day
when new accounts created after this time will not be billed until
the next billing day.  This is used to prevent new accounts from
being given the current billing date after the batch has already
been processed for the day.  This time field is in 24 hour time format.  
</p>
<p>
The Weekend indicators allow the billing system to automatically
skip certain days when assigning new billing dates to new
customers.  This is especially usefull for billing around
weekends, so that a new customer's billing date does not fall on a
weekend.  You can choose what days of the week you want to assign
as weekends here.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.4">3.4 Users </h3>
<div id="text-3.4">


<p>
The Users Tool will allow you to add CitrusDB database users.
This is used to add your staff personnel that will be using the
database to access customer information and billing.  The user
tool will show you a list of current users.  In the default
installation there will be two users present.  An admin user that
has all privileges to edit everything about the database, and an
online user that is used to demonstrate the online customer
account manager's message notification.  If you have not yet done
so, you should change the password for both the Admin user and
Online Request user to something new.  
</p>
<p>
To add a new user click Add New Database User.  You will then be
presented with a form to fill out, including the user's real name,
their username, and their password.  You will also choose their
tool privileges here.  Admin privileges will allow access to add
new users, edit billing types, add new services, and add new
modules. The Manager privilege will allow access to the credit
card import/export features, invoices, payments,  reports, and
account activation.  All other users should have No selected for
both Admin and Manager privileges.
</p>
<p>
You can edit existing users by clicking the Edit link next to
their name.  This will allow you to change their tool privileges,
their username, and their password.  You can also delete a user by
clicking the Delete link next to their name.  When you delete a
user or change their username, any notes they have made will
stay in the database under their old username.  You will also need
to update any groups they are a part of to include their new username.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.5">3.5 Groups </h3>
<div id="text-3.5">

<p>The Groups tool is used to assign users to different groups for 
notification and permission purposes.  By default all the users
who are added to the database are put in the "users" group.  This
should probably not be changed, since it affects access to many
pieces of the system.  You can add as many other groups as
necessary. For instance, if you have a group of people who perform
shipping duties, you might make a shipping group and assign them
to this group.  When a particular piece of equipment is needed you
can send a note to the shipping group, which will notify all the
individuals in that group about your message.  When someone in the
group marks the message finished, it will dissapear from view of
all the people in the group.
</p>
<p>
This is also where you will add the billing group you specified
in the settings tool if you are using the carrier dependent
service functions.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.6">3.6 Billing Types </h3>
<div id="text-3.6">

<p>The Edit Billing Types tool will allow you to edit what billing
types are available in the customer's billing record.  CitrusDB
comes with a number of billing types already created, so you may
not need to create more.  In fact, it may be better to delete
those that you do not need, so they don't get in the way.  There
are 6 methods of billing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
creditcard: For billing via a credit card batch export.

</li>
<li>
einvoice: For emailing invoices.  The invoice is in pdf format,
and will be sent to the email address indicated on the billing record.

</li>
<li>
invoice: For printed invoices.

</li>
<li>
prepaycc: For prepayments done with a creditcard.  A prepaid
account will not have it's payment dates updated until payment is
made, it will not go into a Past Due status, it will become Not
Renewed, and should be turned off if left un-renewed.

</li>
<li>
prepay: For prepayments done via checks, cash, or electronic funds
transfer.  A prepaid account will not have it's payment dates
updated until payment is made, it will not go into a Past Due
status, it will become Not Renewed, and should be turned off if
left un-renewed.

</li>
<li>
free: For free accounts.  These accounts will never be billed and
will never be past due.  The free billing type can be used for
items like demo accounts or temporary free items.

</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to add new billing types, they can be added using the
form at the bottom of the Edit Billing Types tool window.  You
will need to provide the name of the new billing type.  This will
show up in the list in the billing record.  The frequency of the
billing type.  This frequency is used to determine how often (in
months) that billing type is processed.  For example a Monthly
billing type would use a frequency of 1, a Yearly billing type
would use a frequency of 12 (for the 12 months between bills).  There
is also a special case frequency of 0 (zero) for a free or one
time billing type.  Lastly, select what billing method this new billing
type will use, creditcard, prepay, invoice, einvoice, etc.
</p>
<p>
You can remove billing types from the database, however before
doing so you will want to make sure that none of your current
billing records are using that billing type, otherwise they may
not get billed properly.

<div id="outline-container-3.7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.7">3.7 Holidays </h3>
<div id="text-3.7">

<p>CitrusDB has a table in the database called "holiday".  This table
consists of just one date field called "holiday_date" that holds
dates that are billing holidays when billing is not preformed.  If
a new customer's billing date should fall on one of these days it
will be moved up a day until it does not fall on a holiday.  You
should determine what holidays there are during the year that are
not already covered by the weekends setting when 
billing will not be performed and add those dates to the table.  This
table can only be edited by using a database editor such as
phpMyAdmin or SQL insert queries.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.8">3.8 Services </h3>
<div id="text-3.8">


<p>
CitrusDB comes with a default example service, credit, and prorate
services.  To make CitrusDB work for your organization you will
have to add your services using the Edit Services tool.  CitrusDB
can support many different kinds of services, one time services
and fees, recurring services, taxes and fees, linked or bundled
services, and services with measured usage or hourly cost. 
</p>
<p>
Open the Edit Services tool to see all your current services.
Click Add New Service to begin adding the services that you
provide.  
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.8.1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3.8.1">3.8.1 Adding Your Services </h4>
<div id="text-3.8.1">


<p>
The Billed By menu lets you choose which organization this service
is billed by.  This would only change if you have more than one
brand organization inside of your citrusdb installation.
</p>
<p>
The Description field holds the service name that will appear in
the service listing and on invoices.   
</p>
<p>
Price holds the unit price of the service.  For example if you
have a service that is 9.95 per month, enter 9.95, if you have a
service that is 39.95 per year, enter 39.95, a service that is
70.00 per hour, enter 70.00. 
</p>
<p>
The Frequency indicates the service's monthly billing cycle.  A
service that is billed monthly would have a frequency of 1 (for
every month), a service that is billed yearly would have a
frequency of 12 (for every 12 months), a service that is only
billed one time would have the special frequency of 0 (zero) for a
one time service.  One time services are automatically removed
from the customer's service record listing and put into the
service history after they are billed. 
</p>
<p>
The Options/Attributes Table field holds the name of the table
that holds the attributes for that service.  When you make a
service, you can also name a table in the database that holds the
attributes that are associated with that service, such as
location, equipment, usernames, special contact info, anything
that may be associated with that service itself.  This options table name
is not required, so if your service has no attributes you can
leave this blank, however if you add an attributes table at a
later time the services that were already added will not be associated
with the new attributes.
</p>
<p>
The attributes tables allow CitrusDB to support any
kind of service at all, so it is not limited to one industry.  If
you are making a new attributes table, choose a table name and
enter it in the Options/Attributes Table field.  After you have
added the service, go to the Options/Attributes Table link at the
top and click Create next to the table name in the listing.  This
will create an empty table with the correct fields to link it with
your new service.  You can then add any attribute fields you want
after the first two relationship fields, using SQL alter table
commands or a tool like phpMyAdmin. 
</p>
<p>
Most of the attribute fields will be shown as simple text fields,
however if you want to make a menu of choices, or a Yes/No choice,
you can use an enum field type that will show all the items in the
enum within a drop down selection on the web page. You can also
add text or blob fields that will be shown as textarea entry fields.
</p>
<p>
The Category field is a case sensitive name of a category to group
the service under when choosing services to add to the customer's
service record.  This can be left blank if you only have a few
services, but when you have many services it will be helpful to
organize them into categories so you can jump to the type of
service you are looking for.
</p>
<p>
Selling Active is on by default.  It indicates whether this
service is currently being sold.  If set to Yes, it will show up
in the list of services that can be added to an account.  If set
to No, it will not show up in the list of services that can be
added to an account, however it can still be billed to customers
who still have the service.  This can be used to deactivate
services that were only available for a limited time and are still
being billed, but are no longer available for new sales.     
</p>
<p>
The Hide Online field is set to No by default.  This indicates
whether you want to show or hide this service in the customer
account manager and in the default view when adding services. 
You will probably will want to hide services such as setup fees,
install fees, and sometimes bundled services.  The services are
hidden to regular internal CitrusDB users, and are only
visible to manager and admin users using the Show All link when
adding services to a customer. 
</p>
<p>
The Activate Notify field holds the username or group name of the
CitrusDB user who will be sent a support ticket note when this
kind of service is added to an account.  This can be used to
notify order coordinators or a service activation department about
services being added to an account if further manual processing is
required. 
</p>
<p>
The Shutoff Notify field holds the username or group name of the
CitrusDB user who will be sent a support ticket note when this
service is removed from an account.  This can be used to notify
order coordinators or a service activation department about
services being removed from an account if further manual
processing is required. 
</p>
<p>
The Modification Notify field holds the username or group name of the
CitrusDB user who will be sent a support ticket for services are
are to be enabled, that were previously disabled, but not totally shutoff.
</p>
<p>
The Support Notify field holds the username or group name of the
CitrusDB user who will be entered by default in new support
tickets that are opened for this service.
</p>
<p>
Activation String is used to hold the field names that are passed
to the statusupdate tool with this service.  For example,
when you add a new Internet account service you will probably want
to provide the username and password from the options_table to the
account activation system.  To do that enter the string
“username,password” in the Activation String field.  The field
names must be entered in matching case and be comma seperated with
no spaces or other characters between the field name. 
</p>
<p>
The Usage Label is used to label the Measured Usage field when
adding measured usage services.  For example if you have a service
that is 70.00 per hour, you would put “hours” in this field, or if
you have a service that is 5.00 per gigabytes, you would put
“gigabytes” in this field. 
</p>
<p>
Carrier Dependent services are those that are provided by a third
party that needs a seperate notification of service activation and
deactivation that is not part of your own account activation
system.  A Carrier Dependent service has additional steps when
they are being deactivated that will send a shutoff notice to the
customer to make sure they are aware the service is being
shutoff.  It will also send simultaneous notifications to the
default billing group that is indicated in the Settings so
that group can take care of communication to the third party carrier
about what to do with a past due, turned off, or canceled
service.
</p>
<p>
A carrier dependent service that owes money when their account
is canceled will be marked as the status cancelwfee instead of
canceled so that the billing group can find those customers and go
after them for the money they owe.  This is usually necessary
since as a provider you will owe money for those services to the third
party that was providing them and will have more incentive to collect
on those charges rather than just cancel that service and be
done with their account.
</p>
<p>
After you have filled in all the relevant service information you can click
the Add button to add your new service to the database.  You
can now assign this service to your customers. 
</p>
<p>
If you have many many services to add it may be easier to make a
spreadsheet with all their attributes and import them into the
master_services table directly using SQL insert queries or a database
editor such as phpMyAdmin.

<p>Setup Fees and Bundled services are added like any other service
using the Add New Service function.  After you have added the
setup fee or bundle service, choose the Link Services item to

<div id="text-3.10">

<p>CitrusDB comes with some default tax rates for certain locations.
This data may be incorrect or out of date, please consult your
local tax code to make sure you are billing for the correct tax amounts.
</p>
<p>
To add a new tax rate click the Taxes link in the Service
Editor. and then click on Tax Rates.  At the bottom of the Tax
Rates screen is a form to add new Tax Rates.  The Description
holds the name of the tax, for example “Massachusetts Sales Tax”.
The Rate holds the percentage of the tax, for a 5% tax enter
“0.05”.  The If-Field holds the name of the field in the customer
record that is checked to see if this tax applies to the customer.
For example, if the tax is based on what state a customer is in,
enter “state”.  The field names are the names according to the SQL
database names for matching customer table columns, and will
usually be in all lower case.  The last field is the If Value, if
this tax is for customers who are only in the state of
Massachusetts, enter “MA” in the Value field.  You can leave the
If Field and If Value fields blank if the tax is applied
regardless of the customer attributes.
</p>
<p>
You can remove tax rates by clicking on the Delete link.  Make

<p>Field assets refer to devices out in the field like customer
premises equipment (CPE) or other devices you want to track that
are associated with a service.
</p>
<p>
To add Field Assets to a service first you must setup what Field
Assets types are available for each category of service.  Open the
edit services tool and click on Edit Field Asset Types.  Here you
can enter the device description, choose the status of current for
devices that
you are currently shipping to your customers.  If you have devices
in the field but do not ship them to customers anymore you can
change the device to the old status using this same edit screen.
You can enter the weight of the device here which is not used yet,
but may  be used some day to calculate a shipping fee.  Finally
choose what service category that this device belongs to.  
</p>
<p>
Now that you have added your Field Assets when you edit a
customers' service you will see a choice called Ship Field Asset
under the service attributes.  If you want to track a field asset
shipment you can then choose the type of field asset you are
shipping and then enter the device details and shipping
information.  This will now associate this device with that service

<div id="text-3.12">

<p>CitrusDB comes with a number of searches pre-installed in the
searches table.  Search fields are edited in each module's
search.php file and show up on the search page.  You will probably
want to create search queries for your new service attributes, so
you can find services by the specific attributes that have been
specified in their options/attributes table.    You can add new
searches by adding a new row to the searches table. For example in
the query field: 
</p>



<pre class="example">
   SELECT * FROM customer WHERE phone LIKE '%%s1%%' 
</pre>




<p>
This will allow you to search the customer table for a phone
number. The %%s1%% will be replaced with the information filled
out in the search form. Then link to the search row id using a
small input form in the corresponding module search.php page. In
this case you would edit the /modules/customer/search.php file and
add new html for a form:
</p>



<pre class="example">
   &lt;form ACTION="index.php?load=dosearch&amp;type=fs" METHOD="POST"&gt;
   Find Phone Number: &lt;input type=text name=s1&gt;

<h3 id="sec-3.13">3.13 Attribute/Option URL Links </h3>
<div id="text-3.13">

<p>You can add a link to the right of the service attribute field that
will allow users to query a web address with that service
attribute. This can be used for things like checking the finger
results on a Unix server or checking other account status through a
website. The URL Options Links are stored in a table called
options_urls. You can add new links or edit existing ones using SQL
queries or a utility like phpMyAdmin. The URL link is matched by
the name of the attributes table field, so any attributes table
with a matching name will get a link next to it. For example if you
have a username field and you want people to be able to run a
finger.cgi on any attribute table field with a name of username you
would make a new entry into the options_url table with the
fieldname of username and a url such as
</p>



<pre class="example">
   http://www.example.com/finger.cgi?%s1%
</pre>




<p>
the %s1% is a place holder where the value of the attribute will be
put into the URL.

<h3 id="sec-4.1">4.1 Searching for Customers </h3>
<div id="text-4.1">

<p>After CitrusDB has been setup and customers have been entered into
the database, the most common thing one will do when first dealing
with a customer is search for their record in the database.  To
search for a customer record, click the Search icon at the top of
the screen.  This will show you the available searches you can
perform.  You can find customers by their account number, their
name, their company, and many other bits of customer information.
Additional searches can be added by the server administrator by
editing the searches table and search.php files, detailed in
chapter two. 
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.2">4.2 Customer Records </h3>
<div id="text-4.2">


<p>
When you have a new customer to add to the database click the New
icon at the top of the screen.  This will prompt you to fill in
some standard customer information, such as their name, address,
and phone number.  After you have filled in their information,
click the Add button.  This will make a new customer record, and
take you to the customer record where you can begin adding their
new service and billing records by clicking on the service and
billing tabs on the left.  Adding new service and billing records
is detailed below.  After you have added service and billing
records for the customer, that record is considered complete and
ready for billing and service provisioning. 
</p>
<p>
To edit the customer's record click the Edit Customer link
at the top of the customer record screen.  This will allow you to
edit the information about the customer, such as their address,
phone number, or email address.  When you edit the customer
record, this does not automaticaly affect their billing record.
After you have saved your changes to the customer record you will
be promted to update the billing record with the matching
information.  Click Yes if the customer's billing information
should match.  Otherwise you will need to edit the billing record
seperately. 
</p>
<p>
If a customer wishes to cancel their services and will no longer
have any customer relationship with your organization, you can
cancel a customer using the Cancel link at the top of the customer
record.  You will then be asked if you are sure you want to cancel
this customer.  When you cancel a customer it will deactivate all
the services on their account and the account will no longer
generate new bills for services.  If you want to un-cancel the
customer's record you can click the Uncancel customer link that
will show up on a canceled customer record.  Add their services
back onto the account, and edit their billing so that it begins
billing them as before.
</p></div>

<div id="outline-container-4.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.3">4.3 Billing Records </h3>
<div id="text-4.3">


<p>
After you have added a customer record you'll want to edit their
billing record.  Click the Billing tab on the left side.  If this
is a new customer, the billing record will have copied the customer
address from the custsomer record, but will have empty billing
method and may have ivalid billing dates.  If the customer's
contact information will not match their billing contact
information, you must edit the record to add their billing address
information to the billing record.  You are then ready to edit
their rest of their billing record. 
</p>
<p>
Most customers will have just one default billing record.
Alternate billing records can be associated with services when
those services require billing that differs from the customer's
default.  To edit the default billing record click the Edit
Default Billing link at the top.  If you need to edit an alternate
billing record, click the alternate billing record's ID number in
the alternate billing list.  This will bring up the billing record
editor. 
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.4">4.4 Editing Billing Records </h3>
<div id="text-4.4">

<p>In the billing record editor you can update their billing address,
phone, email and billing type.  When you add a new customer
billing record much of the address information will be copied from the
customer information so that billing can be processed.  If you
didn't copy the customer information into the billing record when
editing the customer record, you'll need to start by filling in
the customer's billing contact information.  This will hold the
address that an invoice is mailed to, the email address an
e-invoice is emailed to, and the address that a credit card is
verified against.   
</p>
<p>
You will also choose the billing type here.  There are many
billing types to choose from.  Depending on what kind of services
the customer has, it may restrict what billing types are
compatible with that service.  A service cannot have a billing
type that has a billing cycle frequency that is smaller than the
service frequency.  For example, if the customer has a service on
their record that is a Quarterly Subscription Service that is
billed every 3 months, they must have a billing type that is also
billed every 3 months or a greater multiple of 3 months, such as
yearly (which will multiply that service cost * 4 when billed
yearly).  This is one of the reasons you may need to add alternate
billing types to an account, if the customer has services that are
billed at many different intervals. 
</p>
<p>
When you add a new billing record the next billing date is filled
in with today's date, or if it is a holiday or after the billing
rollover time setup by the server administrator, the next
available billing date.  A From date of today, and a To date that
is automatically set according to the length of the billing cycle
specified by the chosen billing type.  The payment due date is
also entered as today's date on a new billing record.  A payment
due date of today may be fine when billing is done by daily credit
card batches, however if the service is invoiced or billed
differently, this date may need to be edited.  The payment due date
is very important to get right if you are using the statusupdate
script to automatically update customer status information.  That
script relies on the payment due date to determine what status the
account should be in, whether to turn it off or back on etc.
</p>
<p>
When accounts are billed by credit card, invoice, or einvoice, the
billing dates are moved forward automatically according to the
billing type's cycle.  Accounts with a prepaid billing type will
have their billing dates automatically moved forward after the
currently due payment has been made.

<h3 id="sec-4.7">4.7 Prorate Services </h3>
<div id="text-4.7">

<p>If billing is not performed daily, the next billing date field may
need to be edited to conform to your billing cycles, and prorate
service types will need to be added to the account to make up the
difference in price. 
</p>
<p>
Most installations of citrusdb include a pre-made Prorate service.
This service may be hidden from view of regular users, an admin or
manager may need to add the Prorate type using Show All. If you do
not have a pre-made Prorate service you will need to add one. A
Prorate service is simply a service with a frequency of zero, a
Price rate of 1, and a Usage Label of whatever currency you are
using.  
</p>
<p>
First add the service they are getting to their account and then
add a onetime prorate service to the customer's account. When
adding the prorate service set the Measured Usage Multiple to the
amount you want to prorate the account for to get it into the
right billing cycle. You need to do a little math here on your
own. For example, if you add a 19.95 service, in a 30 day month
each day is 0.665 cents. If you want to bill them on July 1st, and
today is June 8th, then there are 22 days of prorated service,
which is 14.63. So put 14.63 in the Multiple field. Their first
bill will then equal 34.58 with the service item plus the prorate
item.  
</p>
<p>
In the billing section for that customer you would set their next
billing date to be July 1st, set the from date to July 1st also,
and then it will fill in the to date equal to whatever number of
months the billing type covers starting July 1st, so if you had a
monthly invoice service the to date would be August 1st. This will
make the billing dates at the top of the invoice not exactly match
the prorate time period since there is a prorate item in there and
they really started service on the 8th. In the prorate description
one could put the date of the prorate period.

services that are on the account.  To add new services to an
account click Add Service on the Services tab.  This will bring you
to a list of all the services available for sale.  Scroll down the
list, or choose the service category to jump to a category of
services to choose from.  Click the Add button to begin adding the service. 
</p>
<p>
When you are adding a service, it will then bring up the service
editor which will allow you to fill in fields for any service
attributes and the measured usage amount, if the service is billed
via measured usage, such as per hour, per minute, or per megabyte.
After you have filled in any attribute information necessary,
click the Add button.  You will then be returned to the list of
services on the account, and will see the new service listed
there.  The service will be added with the default billing type.
If there are other services linked with the one you added, or if
the service has taxes associated with it, those will be shown
also.  If the service has others linked to it, those will also have
been added to the record, such as setup fees or bundled services.
</p>
<p>
If you add a service that requires a different billing frequency,
you will get a message that says “Fix Billing Frequency”.  If you
have not setup the customer's billing record yet, you can ignore
this message for now.   This error will appear if their billing
type has a billing cycle that is less than the service frequency.
For example, you will receive this error when the account has a
billing type with a  monthly cycle such as a monthly credit card
bill, but a service that should be billed yearly, such as a yearly
Internet service subscription.  If the customer has alternate
billing types that should be used for that service, click the Edit
button and choose the alternate billing ID from the menu to assign
this service to that billing record.  You may want to add a
different, but comparable service that is billed monthly so they
can keep their billing simple, or make a new alternate billing
type and assign this service to that new billing type.

<p>
CitrusDB's credit card system is built to export a credit card
batch that would be processed via upload to a credit card batch
processor.  Most credit card billing systems such as
authorize.net, paypal, and regular merchant banks have a batch
processing option.  This allows you to upload a text file in a
specific format for credit card processing.  The format of this
file can be specified by the Credit Card Variable export order in
the General configuration. 
</p>
<p>
Exporting Credit Cards
</p>
<p>
To export a credit card batch click on the Tools icon and select
the Export Credit Cards icon. This tool is used to export the
credit cards into a batch format. This will prompt you for what
date you want bill and the secret passphrase that will decrypt the
card data. It will then show you a summary of the
services it found to bill and saves the card data to a
file. This file will be stored in the folder you specified using
the Path To Credit Card File in the general configuration. This
can be used in conjunction with cron jobs or scripts that check
for new billing files and process them automatically. The
interface also gives you the option to download the file to
process it on your local PC. This file can then be formatted and
transmitted to your credit card billing provider via a batch
upload.  Your server administrator will be able to inform
you of any additional steps necessary. 
</p>
<p>
Importing Credit Cards
</p>
<p>
After a credit card batch has been processed the results need to
be imported back into CitrusDB for crediting to accounts.  To
import the batch go to the Tools and select the Import Credit
Cards icon.  This will prompt you to browse your hard drive for
the batch results file from your credit card processing
system. The format for each line of this file is 
</p>



<pre class="example">

   "trxcode","ccnum","ccexpire","amount","billingid","Y/N","avs"

</pre>




<ul>
<li>
trxcode: this is the transaction code associated with this unique
transaction

</li>
<li>
ccnum: this it the credit card number, it should probably come
back with most of it starred out, eg, 4*********111

</li>
<li>
ccexpire: this is the expiration date of the card that was run

</li>
<li>
amount: this is the amount the card was run for

</li>
<li>
billingid: this is the billing id that identifies the customer
billing record that was run.  This is required to connect it to
the right customer.

</li>
<li>
Y/N: this is the letter Y or N that should indicate whether the
card was authorized with a Y or declined with an N

</li>
<li>
avs: this is the status of the AVS processing that will show
whether the address matched or not.

</li>
</ul>

<p>The server administrator may need to make a script that converts
the results from the bank into the format that CitrusDB imports.
Upon importing this file, account records will have their billing
status updated accordingly and an email message will be mailed to
those customers who have had their credit card declined.  You can
specify what the message says by editing the Declined Subject and

a customer's billing record, you can email invoices on the days
you have chosen. 
</p>
<p>
Click on Tools and select the Email New Invoices icon. This tool
can email batches of invoices based on their Next Billing Date, or
individual invoices based on their Billing ID number, or Account
Number. After you enter this information it will then provide you
with a summary of what it found and prompt you to email the
invoices. The invoice will be sent as a pdf file attached to email to
the billing_email specified in their billing record.  The web
server that is running CitrusDB server must be properly configured
to send email.  This tool is a prime candidate to be automated by
running a modified copy of it using the php command line program

When there is a cash or check payment, or an electronic funds
transfer (eft) is made, you can use the Enter Payments tool to
enter the payments made to the account.  You can apply a payment
in three different ways.  By Account Number, which will apply the
payment to the oldest fees still due on that account's default
billing record.  By Billing ID, which will apply the payment to
the oldest fees still due for services under that billing id.  By
Invoice Number, which will apply the payment to the oldest fees
still due on that one invoice.  You must also enter the payment
amount, and the payment type, and if necessary the check number. 
</p>
<p>
If an over-payment is made, the payment utility will tell you that
there is an amount left over.  You can then apply this amount as
necessary to the account, either by applying that payment to a
different invoice, billing id, or making a credit in the account
service record.

<div id="text-6">

<p>CitrusDB requires operating system and database administration
skills to maintain an installation in a production setting.  There
are a few things that are a unique requirement of a billing system
that I will cover in this chapter, such as security requirements,
backing up the data, customization, and automation of billing tasks. 
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6.1">6.1 Backups </h3>
<div id="text-6.1">

<p>Having up to date backups are very important for a billing system,
since your whole business will rely on it for their day-to-day
work.  You should implement a backup policy that takes into
account your uptime requirements.  Backups can be performed
nightly or as needed using the standard MySQL backup utility
mysqldump: 
</p>



<pre class="example">
   mysqldump –user &lt;username&gt; –password &lt;passwd&gt; db_name &gt; backup.sql 
</pre>




<p>
This command can be added to a nightly cron script on a Unix
server, or a windows batch script.

<div id="outline-container-6.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6.2">6.2 Custom Modules </h3>
<div id="text-6.2">

<p>All the tabs on the left side, such as the default ones of
Customer, Services, Billing, and Support are called modules.  You
can add new tabs here that hold your own information by adding a
new custom module with your own php code that does whatever you
need it to do, such as querying database tables, or storing
additional customer information that is unique to your operation.
A module is simply a folder inside the modules folder with an
index.php file and other files that make up  the functions of the
module.  Some modules may or may not need all these functions.  If
they don't need the function, please make an empty file for that
function. 
</p>
<p>
If you are making a new module, it should conform to a few
functions to make sure one can use the major functions of any
module without knowing all of it's details. 
</p>
<p>
The following files are required, index.php, create.php, edit.php,
delete.php, and search.php file.  When making a new custom module
you may want to start with one that is already there.  I recommend
copying the Support module and renaming it.  The Support module is
one of the smaller modules and a good starting place to edit it
and make your own modules. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
index.php

</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the default file.  It has code to include the other files
when called with edit=on or similar it will also provide the view
of the data by default
</p>
<p>
example of index.php:
</p>



<pre class="example">
   if(constant("INDEX_CITRUS") &lt;&gt; 1){
    echo "You must be logged in to run this.  Goodbye.";
    exit;
   }
   
   if (!defined("INDEX_CITRUS")) {
    echo "You must be logged in to run this.  Goodbye.";
    exit;
   }

   include('include/permissions.inc');

   if ($edit) {
     if ($pallow_modify) {
       include('edit.php'); 
     } else permission_error();
   } else if ($create) {
     if ($pallow_create) { 
       include('create.php');
     } else permission_error();
   } else if ($delete) {
      if ($pallow_remove) {
        include('delete.php');
      } else permission_error();
   } else if ($pallow_view) {
      //
      // YOUR DEFAULT CODE GOES HERE
      //
   } else permission_error();

</pre>




<ul>
<li>
create.php
this will be used to create a new record for that module function.  
for example, with the services module, this would create a new service for 
that customer, called with create=on

</li>
<li>
edit.php
this will be used to edit a record for that module function.  
for example, with the billing module, this would edit the billing for 
the specified billing id, called with edit=on, often called with an id 
value to specify a billing_id, or user_service_id etc.

</li>
<li>
delete.php
this will be used to delete a record for that modules function.  
for example, with the services module, this would remove the service
from that customer, called with delete=on

</li>
<li>
search.php
this will be included in the main search page.  it will not be
called through the index.php file it will either be empty if your
modules doesn't need search ability, or have form html for
searching the data that your module deals with

</li>
</ul>

<p>example of search.php:
</p>


<pre class="example">
   &lt;form ACTION="index.php?load=dosearch&amp;type=fs" METHOD="POST"&gt;
   Company Name: &lt;input type=text name=s1&gt;
   &lt;input type=hidden name=id value=2&gt; &lt;!-- the id of this search in
   the searches table --&gt; 
   &lt;input type=submit name=submit value="Search" class=smallbutton&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>




<p>
After you have created your module, you'll need to install it into
the system.  Copy your module folder into the modules folder of
CitrusDB.  Open the Edit Modules tool and click Add Module.  This
will ask you for the Common Name of the module, this is the name
you want it to be called in the Tab on the left that users will
see.  The Module Name is the name of the folder that the module is
stored in, this field is case sensitive.  The Sort Order field is
a number that determines what order the tabs are sorted in.

<div id="outline-container-6.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6.3">6.3 Account Activation and Deactivation </h3>
<div id="text-6.3">

<p>There is a script included in the citrusdb folder named
statusupdate.  This script can be run nightly in a unix cron job
or windows task scheduler.  It will create a file in the path you specified
in the general configuration (the same path as credit card data)
with a list of accounts to ADD, DELETE, ENABLE and DISABLE today. 
</p>
<p>
The statusupdate script will also email messages to customers and
make a pdf file for printed messages to be mailed by the billing
adminstrator regarding their past due accounts.  These messages can
be edited in the language files using the $l_notice_text_ variables.
</p>
<p>
This file can be used in conjunction with other cron jobs or
scripts that check for new account files and process them
automatically.   You may want to make a shell script that
calls the statusupdate script and then calls your own account
activation script that works on the file created by statusupdate.
</p>
<p>
It will print an ADD line for new services added today. A DELETE line
for services that have a removal date of today. An ENABLE entry for
services that should be turned back on today that were previously
disabled. A DISABLE line for services that should be shut off today
such as accounts with declined credit cards or past due. It prints
them in a standard text format that could be processed by an
activation script at a later time. 
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>


<pre class="example">
   "ACTION","category","Customer Name","Service Description","field1",...
</pre>




<ul>
<li>
The ACTION will hold the value ADD, DELETE, ENABLE, or DISABLE to
indicate what should be done to the account

</li>
<li>
The category field holds the category you assigned to that
service.  This will allow your custom activation script to check
this field and do things to specific categories of service,
without having to parse the whole service description.

</li>
<li>
This is the customer's name, often entered into the data with
their account

</li>
<li>
This is the description of the service being added from the
database

</li>
<li>
The last fields are holding data from whatever fields have been specified
for that service in the Activation String field in the service
editor.  It will print them all for that service, so it will be a
variable number of fields.  You will probably want to specify the
same fields for each category of service so you will know what
fields you are looking at when you read the category name earlier
in the line.

<div id="text-6.7">


<p>
You can create bills for service usage manually by adding the
service using the service record for that customer and typing in
their measured usage for that service.  If you have many many
services that have usage tracked automatically, for example minutes
of a phone call or megabytes transferred you can create a custom
import script to input this usage data in to a new one time service
charge for the customer every month, or whatever period you are
billing them by.
</p>
<p>
To input service usage data you will first need to create some
place holder services that have a pricerate that is equal to the
service's unit cost.  For example, if you have a service that costs
$1.00 per megabyte, you can make a new one time service called
“Megabyte Use” with a price of $1.00 and a frequency of 0 (zero) so
it is a one time fee.  This is a one time service because a new
service with that month's usage  will be entered every month or
billing period.  When you add this service to a customer you would
fill in the measured usage field with the number of megabytes they
have used, say they used 100 megabytes, then it will multiply their
usage by the price and give you a total of $100 for that service.
</p>
<p>
To automate this service usage input you will need to make a script
that inputs new service records into your MySQL database.  Adding
new services to a customer is done by making entries into the
user_services table.  In order to insert this information you'll
need know the customer's account number, the id of the service that
you are adding, and the amount of usage units.  PHP code to do this
query with the ADODB layer that CitrusDB uses will look something
like this:
</p>



<pre class="example">
   // make the creation date YYYY-MM-DD HOUR:MIN:SEC
   $mydate = date("Y-m-d H:i:s");

   // get the default billing id for the customer's record
   $query = "SELECT * FROM customer 
   WHERE account_number = $account_number";
   $DB-&gt;SetFetchMode(ADODB_FETCH_ASSOC);
   $result = $DB-&gt;Execute($query) or die ("$l_queryfailed");
   $myresult = $result-&gt;fields; 
   $default_billing_id = $myresult['default_billing_id'];
   
   // insert the new service into the user_services table
   $query = "INSERT into user_services (account_number,
   master_service_id, billing_id, start_datetime, salesperson, 
   usage_multiple) 
   VALUES ('$account_number', '$serviceid', '$default_billing_id',
   '$mydate', '$user', '$usage')";
   $result = $DB-&gt;Execute($query) or die ("$l_queryfailed");
</pre>




<p>
If there is an options table that you want to put attributes into
you'll also need to insert that information:
</p>



<pre class="example">
   // use the mysql_insert_id command to get the ID of the row the
   // user_services insert you just did was set to.
   $myinsertid = $DB-&gt;Insert_ID();

   $query = "INSERT into options_table_name
   (user_services,field1,field2,field3...) 
   VALUES ($myinsertid,$field1, $field2, $field3...)";
   $result = $DB-&gt;Execute($query) or die ("$l_queryfailed");
</pre>




<p>
This code will usually be put inside a loop that is reading the
input file that stores the usage data and inputs it into the database.

<p>If you have a form on your website for customers to update their
credit card information, you can use this tool to import their new
information into their default billing record.  Click the Tools
icon and select the Credit Card Changes icon. This tool is used to
import credit card changes that have been sent in via external
methods such as online forms or email messages, usually done after
a card has declined and a notice has been sent to the customer. The
format for this file is:
</p>
<p>
The format for this file is:

You'll need to create a form cgi that saves data in this format and
download this file from your web server's periodically.  You'll
probably want to download and empty this file every day to check if

number on all billing id's assigned to that customer.    
</p></div>

<div id="outline-container-6.9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6.9">6.9 Automation </h3>
<div id="text-6.9">

<p>Most of the pieces of CitrusDB, such as invoicing, e-invoicing,
importing new accounts, exporting credit cards, importing credit
cards, and activating accounts, can be automatically run at
specific times.  It relies on the server's cron scheduling services
on unix servers to run the commands at a specified time, or on a
windows server you could do something similar with the Task Scheduler.
</p>
<p>
There is one part of citrusdb that should be run every day and take
advantage of a cron or task schedule.  That is the statusupdate
script.  This must be run every day to update the billing status of
accounts and also creates a file that contains account information
that can be used to process account changes, new accounts, and
removed accounts.
</p>
<p>
PHP has a command line interpreter that can be used to execute the
citrusdb files.  On a unix server this can be used much like the
perl or shell interpreter is used, so you can put the path to your
php executable like: 
</p>



<pre class="example">
   #!/usr/local/bin/php 
</pre>




<p>
at the top of the script you want to run.  On windows servers you
would run it with a command that is something like: 
</p>



<pre class="example">
   C:\path\to\php\php.exe &lt;filename.php&gt;
</pre>




<p>
To run a CitrusDB script from the command line you'll need to make
a copy of the script to edit, in this case the einvoice.php file
which is inside of the tools/modules/billing folder.  It may be
best to move it up a few levels to the citrusdb folder itself so
your include path's are easier to figure out. With the new copy,
you'll need to edit it to include the stuff from the includes
files, just like it's included in the index.php file normally, so
you'll need to put these near the top of the script:
</p>



<pre class="example">
   // Includes
   include('./include/config.inc.php');
   include("$lang");
   include('./include/database.inc.php');
   include('./include/billing.inc.php');
   require './include/citrus_base.php';
</pre>




<p>
Then you'll need to write some php code in the new script to
generate the input you want, such as today's date in the
billing_date that is being processed, since the form isn't being
accessed by the web, all the input and output needs to be handled
there. You can also remove some things from your new script like
the code that prints the form interface and since this is all going
to be accessed by the computer with pre-programmed input.

<div id="outline-container-6.9.1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-6.9.1">6.9.1 Automatic Credit Card Billing </h4>
<div id="text-6.9.1">

<p>You can automatically bill a credit card batch every day by using
the Export Credit Card tool, or modify the exportcc.php to be
used as a php command line script.
</p>
<p>
Replace the YYYY-MM-DD with the date you want to bill.  This will
cause CitrusDB to save the credit card batch into a file named
exportXX.csv, where XX is the batch number.  Your script can read
this file and send it to your credit card processor in the format
they require.
</p>
<p>
After the credit cards are run you will get a results file from
your credit card processor.  You can import this manually using
the Import Credit Card Batch tool, or you can make a script that
will input the results automatically by inserting data into your
MySQL database.  Here is some example PHP code using the ADODB
layer that CitrusDB uses.  In order to import this data you will
need to know the customer's transaction code, amount they were
billed, their billing id, and the response code from the credit
card company.  This code would usually run in a loop while it
reads the results file and does the necessary processing.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-7">7 Chapter 6: Data Security Implementation Guide </h2>
<div id="text-7">

<p>CitrusDB is believed to fall under the PA-DSS category of a
Back-office system that stores credit card data and is not currently
subject to PA-DSS certification. While CitrusDB itself is not
required to be certified since it does not connect directly with a
merchant bank, it must still be be installed and implemented in a
way that meets the information security requirements that each
merchant is subject to prevent attacks and comply with credit card
regulations and local privacy laws.
</p>
<p>
The PCI Data Security Standards are a good starting point when
implementing  security for any billing
system.  The standards outline the following requirements: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Build and Maintain a Secure Network: Update passwords regularly
and maintain a firewall. 

</li>
<li>
Protect Cardholder Data: Protect stored cardholder data, encrypt
the transmission of cardholder data on public networks like the
Internet. 

</li>
<li>
Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program: Use anti-virus
software, and maintain secure system and applications by keeping
them up-to-date. 

</li>
<li>
Implement Strong Access Control Measures: Require unique ID and
passwords for those with computer access to cardholder data.
Restrict access to only those who need it. 

</li>
<li>
Regularly Monitor and Test Networks: Track access to the network,
and regularly test the security systems. 

</li>
<li>
Maintain an Information Security Policy: Develop a security policy
that your staff follow when dealing with this information. 

</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a simple overview of these security standards.  You can
find the complete documentation online at

<div id="outline-container-7.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7.1">7.1 CitrusDB Configuration </h3>
<div id="text-7.1">

<p>Besides the GPG and SSL configuration CitrusDB has a few
places where you will want to pay special
attention to your settings to make sure that your security is
maintained.  The username and password used in the configuration
to open the database should have the minimal permissions necessary
to access your citrus database and perform the operations.  For
the internal main system this means giving the user access
privileges to just the citrus database and the MySQL Data
and Structure privileges.  For the online public system you must
restrict the access much more.  Make a different database user
with access to the citrus database, but this new database login
name should restrict the access to your citrus database to SELECT
only, and use table specific privileges that allows only SELECT
and INSERT to the customer_history table and SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, and DELETE in the session2 table.  
</p>
<p>
In the configuration you should set the $hidden_hash_var to
something hard to guess.  This passphrase is used to create a
unique cookie value for your CitrusDB login.  You should use a
different passphrase for the internal and online public system.
You do not need to remember this passphrase, so I encourage you to
make it as complicated as you want. 
</p>
<p>
In the general configuration there is a place for the Path To
Credit Card variable.  This should be set to the path to the
folder you wish to store imported and exported credit card data
inside. The path should be outside of your web server's file path,
and if possible outside of PHP's include path to keep it away from
http queries.    
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7.2">7.2 Physical Data Center </h3>
<div id="text-7.2">

<p>Your citrusdb server should be installed in your secure data center
on a segment of the network that is only accessible from your
internal LAN.  Cardholder data should not be stored on a server
connected to the internet.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7.3">7.3 Passwords </h3>
<div id="text-7.3">

<p>Passwords to access the server, database, and web interface should
be strong to help prevent password guessing.  Strong passwords
avoid the use of dictionary words or all numbers, they include
upper and lower case letters, numbers, and punctuation
symbols.  Longer passwords are stronger than short ones, even just
a few letters can make it significantly harder to brute force.
</p>
<p>
Passwords in CitrusDB are stored in a salted bcrypt or md5 hash to make them
harder to recover from the database.  If a user forgets their password the administrator
will need to set a new one using the User editing tool.  If the
administrator forgets their password, they will need direct access
to the database via SQL queries or a utility like phpMyAdmin to
put a new password on their user record.  You will need to hash
your password using the phpass framework before you paste it into the database record.

<h3 id="sec-7.4">7.4 Encrypting and Decrypting card data </h3>
<div id="text-7.4">

<p>New cards entered into the system are encrypted by the
configured GPG command, however if you have a previous version of
citrusdb with card data already in it you will need to encrypt the
cards that are already heald in the system.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-7.4.1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-7.4.1">7.4.1 Encrypting existing card data </h4>
<div id="text-7.4.1">

<p>To encrypt the card data make sure you have setup a working gpg
command in the config file.  Be sure to have a backup of your
database before you run this command.  If the gpg command does
not work or encrypts the cards using a key you are not able to
decrypt then you have lost data.  Run the encryptcards script from
the main citrusdb folder.  This will begin going through the
database looking for unencrypted cards and encrypt them.  This can
take a long time depending on how fast the server is and how much
card data there is.   
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7.4.2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-7.4.2">7.4.2 Changing encryption keys for card data </h4>
<div id="text-7.4.2">

<p>It is a good idea to periodically change the encryption key being
used.  You may want to change to a larger key every few years to
make sure you are ahead of the curve for cryptanalysis attacks on
the smaller key size.  
</p>
<p>
To change they key you will need to first decrypt all the card
data in the database.  This will need to be done when the database
is not being accessed by any users or other processes.  Run the
decryptcards command from the main citrusdb folder.  This will go
through and decyrpt all the cards in the database using the gpg
decrypt command from your config file.  The decryptcards command
takes the passphrase input on the command line, so you may want to run
this command from the console in single user mode if you want to
ensure nobody else may log in while doing this.  This can take
a long time depending on how fast the server is and how much
card data there is.  After you have decrypted the card data you can
create your new gpg key and setup the gpg encryption command to
use this new key.  Then run the encryptcards script to encrypt all
the cards in the database with the new key.

<p>Canceled customer records in the database will not be necessary after a
certain number of years have passed and that customer data is no
longer necessary for business operations and auditing purposes.
</p>
<p>
You will likely need to make a custom script that can remove this for
you since you will need to be deleting data from multiple tables
depending on different criteria.  The first criteria would be to
find the customer records with a cancel_date that is so old you
want to remove all their information.  Once you have a list of
those customers you will then want to remove their information
from a number of tables including billing, billing_details that is
related to their billing table id,
billing_history also related to their billing table id, any
optional tables you've created containing service
attributes that are related to their user_services id,
payment_history related to the billing id , and user_services
which can be related to the account<sub>number</sub> or billing id. Before you run
your customer script you will want to make sure that you have a backup of
the database in case something more than you expected is removed.

<li>
The result of the request, either a success which most queries

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p>
&shy;-homedir
This will specify the path to the .gnupg folder that contains the
key files to be used
</p>
<p>
&shy;-armor
This will encode the output in ASCII Armor format.
</p>
<p>
&shy;-batch
This will tell gpg that it to run in batch mode.
</p>
<p>
&shy;-no-secmem-warning
Some Operating systems may give a warning about secure memory.
This will supress that warning.
</p>
<p>
&shy;-passphrase-fd 0
This will take a passphrase from stdin instead of interactively.
</p>
<p>
&shy;-passphrase-file filename
This will read the passphrase from the file specified instead of interactively.
</p>
<p>
&shy;-yes
answer yes to any prompts
</p>
<p>
&shy;-symmetric
use symmetric encryption instead of asymmetric  Using a symmetric
encryption is usually faster than the regular asymmetric encryption
of gpg, however it requires a way to maintain the security of the
passphrase when encrypting the data since there is no keyfile and
the same passphrase is used both for encryption and decryption.
</p>
<p>
&shy;-personal-cipher-preferences string
Set the list of personal cipher preferences to string. Use gpg
</p>
<p>
&shy;-version 
to get a list of available algorithms, and use none to
set no preference at all. This allows the user to factor in their
own preferred algorithms when algorithms are chosen via recipient
key preferences. The most highly ranked cipher in this list is also
used for the &ndash;symmetric encryption command. 
</p>
<p>
&shy;-no-tty
This will tell gpg not to expect any TTY input
</p>
<p>
&shy;-skip-verify
This will tell gpg to skip the verification of signatures.  It can
make gpg faster when one does not need to verify signatures.

<div id="outline-container-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10">10 Appendix B: OpenSSL Certificate </h2>
<div id="text-10">


<p>
To create a SSL certificate you will first need to create a private
key and the certificate signing request.
</p>



<pre class="example">
   openssl genrsa -out webserver.key 2048
</pre>




<p>
This will create the 2048bit RSA private key.  You can add -des3 to
this command if you want to password protect the key, however that
will require you enter the password whenever the web server starts
up.
</p>



<pre class="example">
   openssl req -new -key webserver.key -out webserver.csr
</pre>




<p>
This command will create a certificate signing request from the
private key.
</p>
<p>
If you are going to send the key to a certificate authority (CA) like 
<a href="https://www.certs4less.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1035&url=3">Certs4Less</a> for
signing then you can send the csr file to the CA instead of
self-signing it.  If you want to run your web server with a self-signed certificate then
you will need to run the signkey command below.  If you are using a
self-signed certificate your web browser may warn you to confirm
and accept the certificate.  If you know the self-signed
certificate is legitimate this offers the same encryption as
any other certificate, however the browser is being cautious
since it does not have an authority record for self-signed
certificates.
</p>



<pre class="example">
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in webserver.csr -signkey
   webserver.key -out webserver.crt
</pre>




<p>
This command will sign request and create a certificate file.
</p>
<p>
After you have a signed certificate you will need to install that
certificate into your web server.
